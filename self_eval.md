# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
  A. i am still feel good about `if, else, elsif` and `and/or` statements. i do want to play around with it more during the next two weeks (ie before Mod1) but i got through the `spicy` challenge quickly.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
  A. i am very confident with these based on the work done. of course, i am sure curveballs await
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
 A. am confident and enjoy `if` statements
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
 A.this was a long section and, alas,i got stuck with a stupid mistake. one of the online resources i found use `prints` instead of  of `puts` (they must use a diff translator)... well, i kept hitting my head against a wall as i was using `prints`. finally i reached out to Carter and he was able to spot the obviouse right away... smg
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
 A. i need to stop struggling through on my own and ask for help a earlier. Carter could have saved me a lot of time by pointing out the mistake noted above a lot earlier.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
 A. no questions at the moment... i just need to make up ground
